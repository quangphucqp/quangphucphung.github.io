In a lab experiment, participants reported their beliefs about the correct answer to a series of logical reasoning questions both before and after receiving recommendations generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo. In one treatment, participants received real-time recommendations from a chatbot, while in the other, they received static, pre-generated recommendations. The informational content of the recommendations, including both the recommended answers and the reasoning behind them, was distributionally matched across treatments. Participants who interacted with the chatbot were slightly more likely to update their beliefs following the AI recommendations, with a 31.46 percentage point change compared to 26.31 in the static treatment (p < 0.084). Further analyses reveal that the chatbot was especially persuasive among participants whose initial beliefs clashed with the recommendations."),a.createElement("p",{className:"mt-4"},a.createElement("em",null,a.createElement("a",{href:s.UA.O,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"[Link to download paper]"))),a.createElement("p",{className:"mt-4"},a.createElement("em",null,a.createElement("a",{href:s.lM.O,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},"[DeepDive podcast]")))),a.createElement("div",{className:"mt-8"},a.createElement("h2",{className:"text-xl font-bold"},"Monitoring as a Service"),a.createElement("p",{className:"mt-2"},a.createElement("strong",null,"Abstract:")," Can a monitoring service help people mitigate procrastination and commit to their plans?

I found that the monitoring service improved the rate at which subjects met their plans by 12.75 percentage points (p < 0.05) and improved the completion rate of the experiment by 19.47 percentage points (p < 0.001). These effects were primarily driven by a reduction in dropout rates. Additionally, subjects who received the monitoring service delayed their starting time by more than an hour.
