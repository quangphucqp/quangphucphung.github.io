All this information from many data-sources may be scraped and aggregated by Aggregatus into collections.\r\n\r\nAggregatus users are able to create many collections (collection of shoes, collection of blog posts etc.). Each collection contains data of certain type with specific set of data properties. For example shoes collection might have data with such data properties as name, photo, category, available sizes and so on.\r\n\r\nYou may check several examples of how those collections may look like by visiting [Nike Shoes](https://aggregatus.io/collection/1) or [Startup News](https://aggregatus.io/collection/2) collections.\r\n\r\n![aggregatus shoes](assets/03-shoes.png)\r\n\r\n## See how it works in action\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_3hk3dTqR4\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nOne of the challenging tasks for the Aggregatus users was a necessity to come up with a proper CSS selector on the 3rd-party web-sites for the elements that users want to parse/scrape the data from.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier the *CSS Wizard* feature was developed. It allows the users to preview the 3rd-party web-site inside the Aggregatus pop-up window, click on the elements that need to be parsed, and immediately get the CSS selector that might be used to scrape the data from the clicked element.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8V3shqtDsrQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n> The project is still in alpha stage of testing. This means that its features may be unstable. But also it means that a lot of new features are on their way. You also may take part in testing the project and [reporting new bugs and ideas](https://aggregatus.io/contact).\r\n\r\n> **UPD 2019:** The service was deprecated...\r\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/aggregatus-service-is-live/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"C:/prj/quangphucphung.github.io/src/posts/2018/aggregatus-service-is-live/index.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aggregatus — new data aggregation service — is now live and in alpha","summary":"Aggregate data from many sources into one collection","date":"07 March, 2018","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/d3fa1/01-cover.png","srcSet":"/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/4e62d/01-cover.png 750w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/f9cb8/01-cover.png 1080w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/49a81/01-cover.png 1366w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/d3fa1/01-cover.png 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/6c11a/01-cover.webp 750w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/ec1f0/01-cover.webp 1080w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/19fca/01-cover.webp 1366w,\n/static/26d12517f074bef42315f12219a81b42/bf387/01-cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6239583333333333}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018/aggregatus-service-is-live/","frontmatter":{"title":"Aggregatus — new data aggregation service — is now live and in alpha","summary":"Aggregate data from many sources into one collection","cover":"assets/01-cover.png","date":"2018-03-07T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3196427994"],"slicesMap":{}}
