Imagine a world of 2D people\r\n        - They operate with 2D concepts of circles, rectangles, triangles, <Math>XY</Math>-axis, etc.\r\n        - But they also want to grasp 3D concepts like a cylinder or torus\r\n        - When a 3D cylinder intersects the 2D world its section might look different: from a circle, through an ellipse, to a square\r\n        - When a 3D torus intersects the 2D world it sometimes is seen by the 2D people as one ellipse or sometimes as two independent circles, or sometimes as one circle inside another\r\n        - Some 2D people may say that there is no such concept as a cylinder, but there are only concepts of circles and squares\r\n        - Some 2D people may say that there is a concept of a cylinder, but a cylinder itself is not more than a circle\r\n        - The idea that a cylinder can be a circle and a square at the same time might sound contradictive to the 2D people\r\n      - We're in a similar situation, except we're 4D people (let's say we have <Math>XYZ</Math> + Time) trying to think about higher dimensions\r\n        -

The question of the ultimate origin of the universe is out of evolution's scope\r\n      - However, it is interesting to mention that the theory doesn't answer the question of the origin of life on Earth either\r\n        - It starts with the self-replication <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor\">LUCA</Link> (last universal common ancestor)\r\n          - The accurate inheritance (self-replication) of the phenotype for future generations is one of the three pillars of evolution along with mutation and natural selection\r\n          - Evolution requires accurate self-replication\r\n            - Giraffes with tall necks must produce giraffes with tall necks to win in the natural selection\r\n            - The feature that helped you to survive must prevail and be accurately carried from generation to generation\r\n            - Otherwise, evolution won't work\r\n          - Evolution, however, doesn't explain how this accurate <Math>(99.9999%)</Math> cell self-replication appeared\r\n          - Accurate inheritance is being taken as an initial state of LUCA\r\n        - Science doesn't answer the question of where LUCA came from or how the self-replication appeared\r\n          - Funny enough, we still don't quite understand how eels mate <Link href=\"https://feeeels.com/The-Eel-Question\" asRef>57</Link>\r\n        - LUCA for biology (and evolution in particular) is like BigBang and Singularity for cosmology\r\n          - For now, science can't answer the question of what was the origin in this case either\r\n      - It is worth noting, that Evolution theory itself has several _fundamental explanatory deficits_ <Link href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDSpLBNQk5I\" asRef>1</Link>\r\n        - The following were mentioned during the Royal Society Meeting in London in 2016 <Link href=\"https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2016/11/evolutionary-biology/\" asRef>2</Link> <Link href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2017.0051\" asRef>56</Link> <Link href=\"https://evolutionnews.org/2016/12/why_the_royal_s/\" asRef>3</Link> <Link href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/28/do-we-need-a-new-theory-of-evolution\" asRef>4</Link> <Link href=\"https://www.sagu.edu/thoughthub/thoughthub/\" asRef>5</Link> <Link href=\"https://www.sagu.edu/thoughthub/stephen-meyer-explains-neo-darwinism-s-false-beliefs-part-2/\" asRef>6</Link>\r\n          - Phenotypic (visible body structure of an organism) complexity\r\n            - The mechanism of mutation and natural selection doesn't explain the origin of new body plans and body types\r\n              - i.e. eyes, ears\r\n            - Complex behaviors\r\n              - i.e. how beavers know how to build dams\r\n          - Phenotypic novelty\r\n            - Darwinian mechanism of mutation and natural selection lacks the creative power to generate the novel anatomical traits and forms of life that have arisen during the history of life <Link href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3woccDLWFU1cvOcQ5Oflue\" asRef>7</Link>\r\n              - These mechanisms do a good job of optimizing or modifying the pre-existing forms to generate a small scale variations\r\n                - i.e. the Galapagos finches that get their beaks a little longer, a little shorter, in response to varying weather patterns\r\n              - But they do a poor job of explaining the origin of those forms\r\n                - i.e. where we get things like birds in the first place\r\n              - A few decades after Darwin, Hugo de Vries expressed it best when he said that *\"Natural selection may explain the survival of the fittest, but it cannot explain the arrival of the fittest\"*\r\n          - Combinatorial problem\r\n            - The ratio between life-allowing/creative and non-successful mutations is enormously low <Link href=\"https://www.sagu.edu/thoughthub/stephen-meyer-explains-neo-darwinism-s-false-beliefs-part-2/\" asRef>6</Link> <Link href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15321723/\" asRef>8</Link>\r\n              - For example, the ratio of the <Math>\"Functional protein folds of a given length\"</Math> to the <Math>\"Number of sequences of a given length\"</Math> is <Math>1 / 10<sup>77</sup></Math>\r\n              - Detailed calculation\r\n                - There are <Math>20</Math> standard amino acids that are commonly found in the proteins *(Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Cysteine, etc.)* <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid\" asRef>45</Link>\r\n                  - This means that for a protein with <Math>n</Math> amino acids in its sequence, there are <Math>20<sup>n</sup></Math> possible combinations.\r\n                - Some proteins may consist of only a *few dozen* amino acids, while others can have *hundreds* or even *thousands* of amino acids in their sequence\r\n                  - For instance, a small protein like *insulin* consists of two polypeptide chains, <Math>A</Math> and <Math>B</Math>, with <Math>21</Math> and <Math>30</Math> amino acids (<Math>51</Math> in general), respectively\r\n                  - On the other hand, large proteins like *titin*, which is found in muscles, can have over <Math>38000</Math> amino acids in their sequence.\r\n                - Therefore, the number of possible ways to arrange these <Math>20</Math> amino acids to form insulin-like proteins can be calculated as: <Math>20<sup>51</sup> ≈ 2.25 x 10<sup>67</sup></Math>\r\n                - For the titin the number of possible ways is: <Math>20<sup>38000</sup> ≈ 2 x 10<sup>92805</sup></Math>\r\n              - Even on the standard geologic time scale (~4B years of Earth's history), the time available to search is not nearly enough to search the number of <Math>10</Math> to the <Math>77</Math> possibilities.\r\n                - To put this number in context, there are between <Math>10<sup>78</sup></Math> to <Math>10<sup>82</sup></Math> atoms in the known, observable universe <Link href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/\" asRef>9</Link>\r\n                - There was only been <Math>4.35 × 10<sup>17</sup></Math> seconds since the Big Bang (<Math>≈13.8</Math> billion years) <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe\" asRef>46</Link>\r\n          - Non-gradual forms or modes of transition\r\n            - Where you see abrupt discontinuities (gaps) in the fossil record between different types\r\n        - The origin of *information* is not explained <Link href=\"https://youtu.be/FDSpLBNQk5I?t=941\" asRef>10</Link>\r\n          - I.e. how the *sequence* of DNA nucleobases (<Math>C</Math>, <Math>G</Math>, <Math>A</Math>, <Math>T</Math>) was written or arranged\r\n            - Such sequence function may be compared to the alphabetic characters in a language or to the sequence of zeroes and ones in the software code\r\n            - Except that one copy of the human genome consists of approximately <Math>3</Math> billion base pairs of DNA <Link href=\"https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Base-Pair\" asRef>11</Link>\r\n              - If we see the Rosetta Stone or a word written on the sand we intuitively conclude that the message (the information) came from the mind (the intelligence) and not from the natural forces like wind and waves\r\n              - What about the longest word ever written which consists of a <Math>3</Math> billions of letters <Math>C</Math>, <Math>G</Math>, <Math>A</Math>, <Math>T</Math>?\r\n            - It is not the physical or chemical properties of the bases that are important to their functioning, but rather it is their sequential arrangement\r\n        - The idea of chemical evolution, when non-living chemicals in a pre-biotic ocean arranged themselves to form the first living cell, is also debatable <Link href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Doubt-Explosive-Origin-Intelligent/dp/0062071483\" asRef>12</Link>\r\n    </SectionBody>\r\n  </Section>\r\n\r\n  <Section\r\n    title=\"science & ultimate origin\"\r\n    hash={Hash.ObservationXGT}\r\n    siblings={[Hash.ObservationBS3]}\r\n    deps={[Hash.ObservationEV2]}\r\n  >\r\n    <SectionHeader>\r\n      ## Science doesn't have an answer to the question of **ultimate origin** for now\r\n    </SectionHeader>\r\n    <SectionBody>\r\n      -

We can continue asking the \"What was before X\" or \"What caused X\" questions until we get stuck\r\n      - We are normally getting stuck at the <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_singularity\">Initial Singularity</Link> or at the <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang\">Big Bang</Link> level\r\n        - *\"The universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature, approximately 13.8 billion years ago\"*\r\n      - The following remain unanswered:\r\n        - How the laws of the universe that singularity followed were created\r\n          - How was it possible to operate with such concepts as temperature and density\r\n          - In other words, where did the <Math>E = mc<sup>2</sup></Math> equation come from (or String Theory equation)\r\n        - How the components (parts) of the singularity were created\r\n        - What is the origin of time\r\n      - The singularity represents a fundamental gap in our knowledge\r\n      - The Simulation Hypothesis or Multiverses idea doesn't answer the question of origin as well\r\n        - It is not clear how was the root universe or root simulation created in this case\r\n        - This hypothesis might require the existence of some sort of the \"universe-generation-mechanism\" which needs to be created and fine-tuned in the first place\r\n      - When people say that *everything* came to be out of \"Nothing\", and that after we die we go back to \"Nothing\", do they actually mean something magnificent behind those \"Nothing\" so that the meaning of \"Nothing\" has been substituted? <Link href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qJguU6sLR-8\" asRef>50</Link>\r\n        - In many cases what scientists mean by \"Nothing\" is not \"Nothing at all\" but rather \"Nothing _material_\" (like spaceless and timeless) <Link href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSYwCaFkYno\" asRef>52</Link>\r\n    </SectionBody>\r\n  </Section>\r\n\r\n  <Section\r\n    title=\"reconsidered theories\"\r\n    hash={Hash.ObservationHT9}\r\n  >\r\n    <SectionHeader>\r\n      ## In science, some **theories** are getting **reconsidered** over time\r\n    </SectionHeader>\r\n    <SectionBody>\r\n      - Science often operates with theories\r\n        - *Theory of relativity*, *String theory*, *Quantum field theory*, *Big Bang theory*, *Field theory*, etc. (see <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics\">more central theories</Link>)\r\n      - Some theories get reconsidered or rejected by scientists over time\r\n        - *Geocentric Model*\r\n          - For centuries, the prevailing view in astronomy was the geocentric model\r\n          - The model proposed that Earth was at the center of the universe, and the sun, moon, planets, and stars revolved around it\r\n        - *Steady-State Theory*\r\n          - The steady-state theory was a cosmological model proposed in the mid-20th century as an alternative to the Big Bang Theory\r\n          - It suggested that the universe was eternal and unchanging, with new matter continually being created to maintain a constant density.\r\n          - However, the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 provided strong evidence in favor of the Big Bang theory and led to the decline of the steady-state theory.\r\n        - *Static Universe Model*\r\n          - Before the discovery of the expanding universe, it was widely believed that the universe was static and unchanging\r\n          - However, Edwin Hubble's observations in the early 20th century provided evidence for the expanding universe, leading to the rejection of the static universe model\r\n        - *The slowing expansion of the universe*\r\n          - This belief persisted for several decades, with the understanding that the universe's expansion was gradually slowing down due to the gravitational attraction of matter\r\n          - However, in the late 1990s, the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe due to dark energy was made through observations of distant supernovae\r\n        - *Phlogiston Theory*\r\n          - The phlogiston theory was a prominent explanation of combustion and oxidation in the 17th and 18th centuries\r\n          - It proposed that a substance called phlogiston was released during combustion, which explained phenomena such as fire and the rusting of metals\r\n          - The theory held that phlogiston was a weightless, colorless, and odorless substance that resided within combustible materials. When a substance burned, it was believed that the phlogiston was released into the air, leaving behind a residue known as the \"calx\" or \"phlogisticated\" substance.\r\n          - The phlogiston theory explained why substances decreased in weight when burned since it was believed that phlogiston had negative weight.

We need to note here though\r\n            - *There is no scientific evidence for the multiverse existence yet*\r\n            - *The \"universe generator\" itself would also require an enormous amount of fine-tuning*\r\n            - *The probability of \"generating\" the fine-tuned universe is astronomically low*\r\n        - But even if the statement above is true, you may think about it in a Machine Learning way\r\n          - Let's call the Universe a \"Neural Network\"\r\n          - Let's call those fine-tuned physical parameters mentioned above the \"weights and biases\" of that \"network\"\r\n          - The concept of parallel universes in this case is similar to the training process of the \"neural network\"\r\n            - We're trying to find an optimal and precise set of \"weights and biases\" using forward/backward propagation and the loss/objective function\r\n          - So even if such a training process took place and even if the concept of multiverses is true, we may assume that we have a \"network designer\" who started a \"training process\" and who set up a \"loss function\" or an \"objective function\" of inventing the universe that supports life\r\n          - This doesn't make the universe we're living in less special or less fine-tuned for our existence\r\n          - You may think about it as inventing and training an AlphaGo, or a ChatGPT-4\r\n            - Does that myriad of attempts/fails/trials during the training process make the ultimate product any less valuable?\r\n            - It is the opposite, it makes them even more special and valuable\r\n      -

*\"It is unfair to take people's freedom away\"*\r\n        - *\"Repressing and suppressing of people is terrible\"*\r\n        - *\"Why do injustice, raping, betrayal, and evil like this happen\"*\r\n        - etc.\r\n      - Consciously or unconsciously we often refer to the objective morality\r\n        - The ultimate global statements of good and evil\r\n      - These ultimate concepts are established neither by human beings nor by a majority, and nor by surrounding culture\r\n      - Otherwise, all those bad things that are mentioned above (injustice, raping, betrayal, etc.) would be just \"personal opinions\" which might be treated as acceptable\r\n        - Think about totalitarian regimes and their crimes and genocides for example\r\n        - Culture is there, the majority (tens of millions) is there, and people's beliefs are also there\r\n          - But can we say that those crimes and wars are acceptable?\r\n          - Can we say that this is their \"personal opinions\" that must be listened to and respected?\r\n          - Even those who proclaim that there is no objective morality, but only a personal truth and personal opinions, have a hard time accepting these bad things as \"personal opinions\" of a group of people that need to be respected\r\n      - From the psychological perspective, it looks like Carl Jung's *Archetypes* <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes\" asRef>54</Link> and *Collective unconscious* <Link href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious\" asRef>55</Link> point in this direction\r\n        - Archetypes are universal symbols or patterns that exist in the collective unconscious of all human beings\r\n        - They exist regardless of culture or historical epoch\r\n          - Some common archetypes include the hero, the shadow, the wise old man, the mother, and others\r\n        - Individuals can reinterpret and adapt archetypal themes within stories and cultural narratives\r\n        - However, the fundamental archetypes themselves are considered to be relatively stable and universal\r\n          - For example, the archetype of the hero may manifest differently in different cultures or time periods, yet it still embodies the universal theme of courage, sacrifice, and triumph over adversity.\r\n          - Similarly, the archetype of the mother may be expressed differently across cultures, but it still represents nurturing, protection, and fertility.\r\n    </SectionBody>\r\n  </Section>\r\n\r\n  <Section\r\n    title=\"good vs evil sensor\"\r\n    hash={Hash.AssumptionHB5}\r\n    deps={[\r\n      Hash.ObservationUR9,\r\n      Hash.ObservationOM3,\r\n    ]}\r\n  >\r\n    <SectionHeader>\r\n      ## Human beings have an embedded **good-vs-evil \"sensor\"**\r\n    </SectionHeader>\r\n    <SectionBody>\r\n      - Human beings can discern *good vs evil* from birth\r\n        - Regardless of the culture, country, political or religious views, language, skin color, or gender\r\n        - Most people genuinely admire true love, support, kindness, sacrifice, etc.\r\n        - Most people feel genuinely disgusted once encountered injustice, raping, lying, betrayal, etc.\r\n      - This explains the demand for movies where good conquers evil in <Reference hash={Hash.ObservationUR9} />\r\n      - An interesting <Link href=\"https://www.bbcearth.com/news/are-we-born-good-or-evil-naughty-or-nice\">experiment</Link> carried out at Yale University\r\n      - Human beings are *free* to repeatedly suppress the signals of this internal good-vs-evil \"sensor\" and act against it\r\n          - When acting wrong most people have an internal conflict or a conviction\r\n          - By repeatedly choosing to go with the \"conflict\" signal rather than with a \"confirmation\" signal of the \"sensor\" a human being can \"program\" their way of thinking (the neuron trails and patterns inside their brain)\r\n          - This formed and chosen way of thinking may get stronger over time and suppress the \"sensor\"\r\n            - This is the situation when people may justify evil, calling it good instead\r\n      - The possibility of discerning good vs evil may not be in sync with how humans ultimately behave\r\n        - Most probably the reader has felt this kind of internal personal conviction as a consequence of some action recently (last month, or week, or even today)\r\n        - People may *do* bad things and *know* that these things are bad at the same time because they have a *free will*\r\n          -
