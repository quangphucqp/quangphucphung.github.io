To display the data I've used [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to draw the chart and [Bootstrap Table](https://bootstrap-table.com/) to display a sortable, searchable, and clickable data table.\r\n\r\n### Main Functionality\r\n\r\nThe dashboard is still raw, but it provides the basic functionality of displaying the global and per-country data charts.\r\n\r\nFor example here is how Global dynamics of confirmed/recovered/deaths use-cases looks like as for March 23rd:\r\n\r\n![Global data](assets/0.png)\r\n\r\nHere we may see positive dynamics for China (Hubei):\r\n\r\n![China - Hubei statistics](assets/1.png)\r\n\r\nWe may also compare Italy to Spain:\r\n\r\n![Italy and Spain statistics](assets/2.png)\r\n\r\nThe regions are displayed in sortable, searchable, and clickable data-table:\r\n\r\n![Data table](assets/3.png)\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\nThe following functionality is not implemented yet but it would improve the usability of the dashboard:\r\n\r\n- Grouping the regions by countries to see aggregated statistics for the whole US, China, etc. (for now statistics for the US is split by states)\r\n- Resetting the regions/countries selection by one click\r\n- Putting the selected filters to the URL so that the dashboard link would be sharable (with pre-selected filters)\r\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"C:/prj/quangphucphung.github.io/src/posts/2020/coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard/index.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Iâ€™ve open-sourced a simple Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard","summary":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard to show the dynamics of Ð¡oronavirus distribution per country","date":"23 March, 2020","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/dbb10/01-cover.png","srcSet":"/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/ab3df/01-cover.png 750w,\n/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/e3472/01-cover.png 1080w,\n/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/dbb10/01-cover.png 1208w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/14d41/01-cover.webp 750w,\n/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/f8d6b/01-cover.webp 1080w,\n/static/0b1e786ce0ff8243fab1a7616c803aee/564d5/01-cover.webp 1208w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5206953642384106}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020/coronavirus-covid-19-dashboard/","frontmatter":{"title":"Iâ€™ve open-sourced a simple Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard","summary":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard to show the dynamics of Ð¡oronavirus distribution per country","cover":"assets/01-cover.png","date":"2020-03-23T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3196427994"],"slicesMap":{}}
