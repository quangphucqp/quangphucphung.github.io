I wanted it to be a place where people could do fast, ad-hoc, napkin-based-like explanations of any concept as if you are sitting with your friend and trying to explain him/her something during lunch. Don't ask me why it is needed, I was just experimenting.\r\n\r\n> Btw, that's why the app name is \"Ok! So...\", because oftentimes these are the opening words after you pick up the pen and the piece of paper (or a whiteboard) and start drawing. I didn't see the study and the statistics of the opening phrases though, so I might be wrong here, here üòÄ\r\n\r\nSo, the first concept I've tried to explain with sketches was the Data Structures. Without further ado, here is the interactive ‚úçüèª [Data Structure Sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) showcase that you may play with.\r\n\r\n![Data Structure Sketches](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-sm-x2.gif)\r\n\r\n> Here is a [YouTube version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaOWTOWOWGk) of the GIF just in case.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all data structures are covered. And of course, this is not comprehensive material, but rather a cheatsheet that would create visual hints and associations for the following data structures:\r\n\r\n- Linked List\r\n- Doubly Linked List\r\n- Queue\r\n- Stack\r\n- Hash Table (with hash collision resolution)\r\n- Tree (including the Binary Search Tree)\r\n- Heap (including Mean Heap and Max Heap)\r\n- Trie\r\n- Graph\r\n\r\nEach box on the sketch is clickable, so you may dig into the data structure you're interested. For example `Heap ‚Üí Max Heap`, or `Heap ‚Üí Min Heap`, or `Heap ‚Üí Array Representation`.\r\n\r\nThe sketches are split into so-called Pages just to make it easier to grasp them, so the users stay focused on one concept at a time, they see the relationship between the concept, and thus, hopefully, they are not getting overwhelmed with seeing a lot of information at the same time on one drawing/page.\r\n\r\nEach page has a link to the source-code examples that are implementing the data structure on JavaScript.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of the sketches.\r\n\r\n**Doubly Linked List**\r\n\r\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-02.png)\r\n\r\n**Tree**\r\n\r\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-03.png)\r\n\r\n**Hash Table**\r\n\r\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-05.png)\r\n\r\n**Trie**\r\n\r\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-04.png)\r\n\r\n**Graph**\r\n\r\n![Doubly Linked List](https://trekhleb.dev/okso-app/assets/demo/demo-12-showcase-data-structures-06.png)\r\n\r\nThe full list you may find in the ‚úçüèª [Data Structure Sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) showcase.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this showcase useful and I hope it will be a good visual cheatsheet-like complement to your data structure knowledge.\r\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2022/data-structure-sketches/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"C:/prj/quangphucphung.github.io/src/posts/2022/data-structure-sketches/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Structure Sketches","summary":"Basic data structures explained with minimalistic sketches","date":"31 August, 2022","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/fdcda/01-cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/45fd3/01-cover.jpg 750w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/ead81/01-cover.jpg 1080w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/761ab/01-cover.jpg 1366w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/fdcda/01-cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/4da20/01-cover.webp 750w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/c46d5/01-cover.webp 1080w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/ae2bb/01-cover.webp 1366w,\n/static/38ffac265b733d493674704f86a733fa/8e997/01-cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.46718750000000003}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2022/data-structure-sketches/","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Structure Sketches","summary":"Basic data structures explained with minimalistic sketches","cover":"assets/01-cover.jpeg","date":"2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3196427994"],"slicesMap":{}}
