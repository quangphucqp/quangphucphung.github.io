Only one potential change in the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.\r\n\r\n![Single Responsibility Principle](assets/05.png)\r\n\r\n## O — Open/Closed Principle\r\n\r\na.k.a [OCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)\r\n\r\nSoftware entities should be open for EXTENSION, but closed for MODIFICATION. Allow behavior to be extended without modifying the source code.\r\n\r\n![Open/Closed Principle](assets/0.png)\r\n\r\n## L — Liskov Substitution Principle\r\n\r\na.k.a. [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)\r\n\r\nObjects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.\r\n\r\n![Liskov Substitution Principle](assets/1.png)\r\n\r\n## I — Interface Segregation Principle\r\n\r\na.k.a. [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)\r\n\r\nMany client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.\r\n\r\n![Interface Segregation Principle](assets/2.png)\r\n\r\n## D — Dependency Inversion Principle\r\n\r\na.k.a. [DIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)\r\n\r\nOne should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.\r\n\r\n- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\r\n- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\r\n\r\n![Dependency Inversion Principle](assets/3.png)\r\n\r\nThe plug doesn’t care which type of wire it uses, it just needs wires that conduct electricity.\r\n\r\nI hope these illustrations have been useful for you :)\r\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017/solid-principles-around-you/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"C:/prj/quangphucphung.github.io/src/posts/2017/solid-principles-around-you/index.md"},"frontmatter":{"title":"S.O.L.I.D.
