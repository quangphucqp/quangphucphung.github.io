In a lab experiment, participants reported their beliefs about the correct answer to a series of logical reasoning questions both before and after receiving recommendations generated by the same AI model. In one treatment, participants received real-time recommendations from a chatbot, while in the other, they received static, pre-generated recommendations. The informational content of the recommendations, including both the recommended answers and the reasoning behind them, was distributionally matched across treatments. Participants who interacted with the chatbot were slightly more likely to update their beliefs following the AI recommendations, with a 31.46 percentage point change compared to 26.31 in the static treatment (p = 0.084).
